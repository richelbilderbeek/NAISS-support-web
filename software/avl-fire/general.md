# How to use AVL/Fire on PDC machines
AVL/Fire is commercial software and the users must provide their own license to the software.
And the AVL license environment variable should be specified in **~/.flexlmrc** e.g. 
```
AVL_LICENSE_FILE=31411@<license_server>.kth.se
```
To see which versions of AVL/Fire are installed on any of the machines at PDC log into the machine and type 
```
module avail fire
```
