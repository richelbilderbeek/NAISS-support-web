Elk is an all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-planewave (FP-LAPW) code [https://elk.sourceforge.net](https://elk.sourceforge.net). Designed to be as developer friendly as possible so that new developments in the field of density functional theory (DFT) can be added quickly and reliably.

## How to use

The Elk installation contained in this module was built with support for the programs and libraries Libxc and Wannier90.
To display info on which environment variables are set when loading the module, use

## How to build Elk

The program was installed using [EasyBuild](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/).
A build in your local file space can be done with

```bash
ml PDC/24.11
ml easybuild-user/4.9.4
eb elk-10.4.9-cpeGNU-24.11.eb --robot
```

See also [Installing software using EasyBuild](https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/software_development/easybuild/).

## Species files, example input files, and Elk make.inc file.

Elk species files and example input files can be found
in the directories
```bash
$EBROOTELK/species
$EBROOTELK/examples
```
For the case that you would like to build a custom version
of Elk, you can find the Elk `make.inc` file which was generated
when building with EasyBuild at
```bash
$EBROOTELK/make.inc
```
