mumax3 is a GPU-accelerated micromagnetic simulation program developed at the DyNaMat group of Prof. Van Waeyenberge at Ghent University.

## How to use


# Running mumax3 on an interactive node on Tegner
You can book a compute node for interactive running mumax3. The command to do this is *salloc* e.g. 
```
salloc --nodes=1 -t 1:00:00 --gres=gpu:K80:2
```
which will book one Haswell node with Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU accelerator for one hour. And then run mumax3 on the compute node using commands 
```
module add mumax3/3.10beta
srun mumax3 myfile.mx3
```

## Submitting a mumax3 job on Tegner
A script for running mumax3 on Tegner called mumax3_run.sh is shown below.
Note that this script does not include all the arguments that you can supply to mumax3 , but you should add/modify the script to suit your needs. You can copy this script to your home directory at PDC and save it as mumax3_run.sh.
sbatch mumax3_run.sh
In this example, we ask to user one GPU for one hour using the *sbatch* command. When the queuing system has processed our request and allocated the node the script steps into action.
