## How to use


# Submitting a multinest job on Tegner
A script for running multinest on Tegner called multinest_run.sh is shown below.
Note that this script does not include all the arguments that you can supply to multinest , but you should add/modify the script to suit your needs. You can copy this script to your home directory at PDC and save it as multinest_run.sh.
sbatch multinest_run.sh
In this example, we ask two nodes for one hour using the *sbatch* command. When the queuing system has processed our request and allocated the node the script steps into action.
Formation on how to submit jobs on Tegner, see `Job Submission on Tegner <https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/run_jobs/job_scheduling/>`_ .
