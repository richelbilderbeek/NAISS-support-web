MicroMagnum is a fast easy-to-use micromagnetic simulator that runs on CPUs as well as on GPUs using the CUDA platform. It combines the speed and flexibility of C++ together with the usability of Python.

## How to use


# Running MicroMagnum on an interactive node on Tegner
You can book a compute node for interactive running MicroMagnum. The command to do this is *salloc* e.g. 
```
salloc --nodes=1 -t 1:00:00 -C Haswell --gres=gpu:K80:2
```
which will book one Haswell node with Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU accelerator for one hour. And then run MicroMagnum on the compute node using commands 
```
module add micromagnum/0.2rc4
python sp4.py -g0
```

## Submitting a MicroMagnum job on Tegner
A script for running MicroMagnum on Tegner called micromagnum_run.sh is shown below.
Note that this script does not include all the arguments that you can supply to micromagnum , but you should add/modify the script to suit your needs. You can copy this script to your home directory at PDC and save it as micromagnum_run.sh.
sbatch micromagnum_run.sh
In this example, we ask to user one GPU for one hour using the *sbatch* command. When the queuing system has processed our request and allocated the node the script steps into action.
