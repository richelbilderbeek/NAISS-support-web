The Pencil Code is a high-order finite-difference code for compressible hydrodynamic
flows with magnetic fields. It is highly modular and can easily be adapted to different
types of problems. The code runs efficiently under MPI on massively parallel shared- or
distributed-memory computers.

## How to use

Since 21 September 2008 the Pencil Code is available under
<http://code.google.com/p/pencil-code/>

To get started, run one of the samples
```
unix\>  cd pencil-code
unix\>  source sourceme.csh  \[or . sourceme.sh\]
unix\>  cd samples/conv-slab
unix\>  mkdir data
```
To set up the symbolic links and compile the code
```
unix\>  pc_setupsrc
unix\>  pc_build  \[ -f /path/to/config/file.conf \]
```
To create the initial condition and run the code
```
unix\>  pc_start  \[ -f /path/to/config/file.conf \]
unix\>  pc_run    \[ -f /path/to/config/file.conf \]
```
See pencil-code/config/hosts/*/*.conf for sample config files. For more details,
see the manual in the doc/ directory (also available from the URL above).

# 
To get started, run the following command
```
unix\>  source  \$PENCIL_HOME/sourceme.csh  \[or . sourceme.sh\]
```
If you are using bash and you do not want to \source sourceme.sh\ on each
session, you can insert the following into your .bashrc and/or .bash_profile
```
export PENCIL_HOME=\$HOME/pencil-code  \[or wherever you have the code\]
_sourceme_quiet=1; . \$PENCIL_HOME/sourceme.sh; unset _sourceme_quiet
```
If you are using csh insert the following into your .cshrc
```
setenv PENCIL_HOME \$HOME/pencil-code \[or wherever you have the code\]
source \$PENCIL_HOME/sourceme.csh
```
