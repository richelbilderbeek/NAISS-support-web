GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations.

## How to use


# Running Octave on an interactive node on Tegner
You can book a compute node for interactive running sage. The command to do this is *salloc* e.g. 
```
tegner$ salloc --nodes=1 -t 1:00:00 -A <project>
salloc: Granted job allocation 2364
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
salloc: Nodes t02n01 are ready for job
```
which will book one computer node (*t02n01.pdc.kth.se* for this case) one hour and *project* should be your projec name. And then from your local compute to login on the computer node and run sage using commands likes 
```
(open a new xterm on your local computer)
local$ ssh -Y username@t02n01.pdc.kth.se #username/node should be changed to yours
t02n01$ module add octave/4.2.1
t02n01$ octave
```
