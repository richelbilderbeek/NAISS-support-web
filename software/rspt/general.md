## How to build RSPt

The program was installed using [EasyBuild](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/).
A build in your local file space can be done with

```bash
ml PDC/24.11
ml easybuild-user/4.9.4
eb rspt-20250228-cpeGNU-24.11.eb --robot
```

See also [Installing software using EasyBuild](https://support.pdc.kth.se/doc/software_development/easybuild/).

## Example input files, and RPSTmake.inc file.

RSPt example input files can be found
in the directory
```bash
$EBROOTRSPT/testsuite
```
For the case that you would like to build a custom version
of RPSt, you can find the `RSPTmake.inc` file which was generated
when building with EasyBuild at
```bash
$EBROOTRSPT/RSPTmake.inc
```
