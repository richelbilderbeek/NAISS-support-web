## Basic Information

### Clusters  nodes  processors  and cores

<!-- About basic HPC architecture -->

Like most high-performance computing facilities, NAISS mainly features **clusters**.
A computer cluster is in the broad sense terminology for a supercomputer,
consisting of a set of connected computers working together so that they can be viewed as a single system.

A **node** is the individual computer part of each cluster. Nodes are analogous to the computers we use everyday.

And each node in turn has **processors** made up of computing entities called **cores**.

### Deciding whether you need HPC for your work

The key feature of our systems (or most HPC resources in general) is large-scale parallelization of computations.
Our resources are used in a wide-range of scientific disciplines.
If you want to find out if you work could benefit from our resources, check if:

* your application require large computional resources
* your application require large memory resources
* your application require GPUs
* your application can be parallelized

<!-- anything else? -->

If you decide to use the resources, welcome on board! We provide you with:

* supercomputer systems for large simulations and calculations
* systems for processing data before and after simulations or calculations
* software for simulation and modelling
* short term storage for large volumes of data
* assistance with using computing and storage resources
* experts in different research fields to assist you with using and/or scaling software

### Who may use NAISS HPC services

NAISS resources are available for both business and academic research.
Academic researchers (from Sweden or Europe) may apply for free time/storage allocations.
Swedish academic researchers and their collaborators will need to apply for an allocation of time/storage
for their projects via [NAISS](https://www.pdc.kth.se/doc/documents/getting_access/get_access.html).

### Account and Time Allocation

Before starting using NAISS resources, you will need to get an account.
Each user account must belong to one or more **Time Allocations**, since we allocate resources and manage job queueing based on
the Time Allocation you belong to and not based on your individual user account. Each Time Allocation includes the following information:

1. list of users belonging to that Time Allocation
1. number of corehours allocated per 30 days period for all members of the Time Allocation
1. an expiration date for the Time Allocation
1. list of clusters available for running jobs

When you submit jobs in a cluster, you should belong to at least one Time Allocation, or the submission will fail.
Using Time Allocations allows us to:

1. Prioritize your submitted jobs compared to other user’s jobs.
1. Keep track of compute-time used within the last 30 days by users and projects.

### How much resources will be needed  corehours

We allocate compute-time on our systems in corehours and you are granted an
amount of corehours on a particular system.
Corehours equals the number of cores used in how many hours.
A time allocation gives you a certain amount of corehours evenly split over the months of the time allocation.

## Basic Linux for new HPC users

<!-- Refer to http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html -->
<!-- Refer to https://www.osc.edu/sites/osc.edu/files/documentation/Intro%20to%20Unix%202015.pdf -->

Working with the resources requires a basic understanding of Linux systems.
Some of our users are new to using Linux-based systems and have asked for introductory materials.
Here is a collection for the basic command-line operations needed to get started.

### Using commands in the shell

The **shell** is the program from which the user controls everything in a text-interface.
When you login to a system remotely, you are already in the shell window of the system.
If you login to your own system, you are probably on a graphical screen.
From there, search for terminal or Ctrl+Alt+T to enter the shell terminal.
In the shell, you can start typing commands to perform some action.

### Useful Shell commands

Upon login we are greeted with the shell

```text
ssh user@dardel.pdc.kth.se
Last login: Fri Aug 8 10:14:59 2017 from example.com
user@dardel-login-1:~> _
```

#### Bash  Files and directories

* Command **pwd** tells me where I am. After login I am in the “home”directory
  ```text
  pwd
  /cfs/klemming/home/u/user
  ```
* I can change the directory with **cd**
  ```text
  cd Private
  /Private
  pwd
  /cfs/klemming/home/u/user/Private
  ```
* I can go one level up with **cd ..**
* I can return to my HOME folder with **cd**
* List the contents with **ls -l**
  ```text
  user@machine:~/tmp/talks
  ls -l
  total 237
  drwx------ 3 user csc-users 2048 Aug 17 15:21 img
  -rw------- 1 user csc-users 18084 Aug 17 15:21 pdc-env.html
  -rw------- 1 user csc-users 222051 Aug 17 15:22 remark-latest.min.js
  ```

#### Bash  creating directories and files

* We create a new directory called *results* and change to it
  ```text
  mkdir results
  cd results
  ```
* Creating and editing files
  * Textfiles can be edited on your local computer and then transferred.
  * Textfiles can also be edited locally using text editor like **nano**/**emacs**/**vim**.

#### Copying  moving renaming and deleting

```text
# copy file
cp draft.txt backup.txt
# recursively copy directory
cp -r results backup
# move rename file
mv draft.txt draft_2.txt
# move rename directory
mv results backup
# move directory one level up
mv results ..
# remove file
rm draft.txt
# remove directory and all its contents
rm -r results
```

#### File permissions with chmod

In Linux systems all files have a user, a group and a set of privileges which determines what resources a user can access.
Every file has three different kind of access: read(r), write(w) and execute(x),
as well as three different kind of permissions depending on if the person is the owner(u=user) of the file,
in the same group(g) or someone else(o=other).

```text
chmod g+w file
```

Adds(+) write(w) permissions for group(g) to the *file*.

There is another way to set the permissions by using numbers.
Assume that each permission equals the number listed below:

|  Number | Type  |
|---|---|
| 0 | no permissions |
| 1 | execute  |
| 2 | write |
| 4 | read |

```text
chmod 753 file
```

Gives the user the read, write and execute permission(4+2+1),
whereas users in the same group get read and execute permissions (4+1)
while others get write and execute permissions (2+1).

#### Access Control Lists

For more fine grained control of access to files, so called POSIX ACLs (Access Control Lists) can be used.
An ACL allows the owner of a file or directory to control access to it on a user-by-user or group-by-group
basis. To view and modify an ACL, the commands getfacl and setfacl are used.

#### getfacl

The command getfacl is used to get file access control lists (ACLs)

```text
getfacl dir
# file  dir1
# owner  lama tst
# group  users
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
```

the directory *dir1* is owned by the user *lama-tst* with permissions read(r), write(w) and execute(x).
The permissions of the *group* and *others* are set to r-x which means that the *group* and *others* can read and execute.

!!! note 

    Use option -c to skip the comment header.

#### setfacl

```text
setfacl -m user:jon:rwx dir1
getfacl -c dir1
user::rwx
user:jon:rwx
group::r-x
mask::rwx
other::r-x
```

Now the user *jon* has been added and can access to *dir1* with permission read(r), write(w) and execute(x).

!!! note

    The options **-x** is used to remove entries from the ACLs of file
    and **-R** to recurse into subdirectories.

#### Bash  history and tab completion

* history preserve commands used
  ```text
  history
  689  cd ..
  691  cd Documents/
  692  cp -r introduction_PDC /cfs/klemming/home/h/hzazzi/Documents/Presentations
  693  ssh dardel.pdc.kth.se
  694  cd introduction_PDC/
  695  ls -l
  696  pwd
  697  history
  ```
* If I want to repeat…
  ```text
  !696
  pwd
  ~/Documents/introduction_PDC
  ```
* Use also the **TAB** key for completion
* **CTRL/R** to search for previous commands
* Arrows up/down to scroll for earlier commands

#### Bash  finding things

* Extract lines which contain an expression with **grep**
  ```text
  # extract all lines that contain searchme
  grep searchme draft.txt
  ```
* If you do not know what a UNIX command does, examine it with **man**
  ```text
  man [command]
  ```
* Find files with **find**
  ```text
  find ~ | grep lostfile.txt
  ```
* We can pipe commands and filter results with |
  ```text
  grep energy results.out | sort | uniq
  ```

#### Bash  Redirecting output

* Print content of a file to screen
  ```text
  cat test.out
  ```
* Redirect output to a file
  ```text
  cat test.out > myfile.txt
  ```
* Append output to a file
  ```text
  cat test.out >> myfile.txt
  ```

#### Bash  Writing shell scripts

```text
#! bin bash
# here we loop over all files that end with * out
for file in *.out; do
  echo $file
  cat $file
done
```

We make the script executable and then run it

```text
# Make it executable
chmod u+x my_script
# run it
./my_script
```

#### Arguments to script can be passed by using **$**

File example

```text
#! bin bash
echo "Hi" $1 $2
```

```text
./myscript Nils Nilsson
Hi Nils Nilsson
```

* **$1..$X:**
  First…Xth argument

To start executing such scripts, you would need to start with a text-editor.
Choosing a text-editor is a matter of personal choice, with Vim and Emacs being traditional and popular programs.
There are also many other new and interesting editors to choose from.
Open your favorite text-editor and copy-paste the file example above and save with file as <script>.
Then run the script by typing `./<script>`.

#### Information about shell commands

Information about a commands can be retrieved from the manual

```text
man <cmd>
```

Also you can get information about where the executable lies

```text
which <cmd>
```

#### Executing your software

Most commands are quite intuitive acronyms and are easy to remember once you start using them.
The usual syntax is

```text
command -option1 arg1 -option2 arg2
```

where `command` is the name of the command,
`-option1` and `-option2` specifies the particulars of the command (they are optional,
there can be as many options as the specific command permits), and `arg1` and `arg2` are
the value of the corresponding options.
In general

```text
command -h
```

Prints information about what options and arguments you can enter.


#### Editing your files

Editing your files on our cluster can be done with several text editors.
**Emacs** and **vi**/**vim** are available on all clusters and can be opened by

```text
$ emacs [filename]
$ vi [filename]
$ vim [filename]
```

In addition, **nano** is available on Dardel as a module

```text
$ module PDC
$ module nano
$ nano [filename]
```

For Linux beginners, **nano** might be a good editor to start with.
**Emacs** and **vi** have steeper learning curves, so a reference
guide is provided here for the most common operations using these editors.

**Emacs**

A complete tour of using **emacs** can be found at
[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/)

Below is a table summarizing the most frequently used operations.
`C-x` means pressing simultaneously the `control`-key and `x`, `C-x 2` means first pressing
both `control`-key and `x` and then pressing `2`, `C-x C-s` means first
pressing `control`-key and `x` followed by `control`-key and `s`, and `M-x` means
pressing the `meta`-key (Alt-key) and `x` simultaneously.

## Glossary

Here you will find the basic terminologies and quick reference materials.


cluster
: Computer cluster is in the broad sense the terminology for a supercomputer,
  consisting of a set of connected computers working together so that they can be viewed as a single system.
  See resources to examine what clusters currently has available.


node
: Nodes are components of a cluster and analogous to the computers we use every day.
  A supercomputer consists of a number of nodes that perform computations and run an own instance of the operating system.


processor
: component of each node. Each node has a number of processors that are
  analogous to the CPU (Central processing unit) in a personal computer.


core
: component of each processor. The actual computing entity.


Time Allocation
: Time Allocation is the technical term for “Project” that users need to be a part of to use the supercomputer.
  Time allocation contains information about the project and how much resources that have been allocated to the project.
  There are different types of time allocation depending on the size of the allocation,
  but the instructions for running jobs are the same.


Principal Investigator (PI)
: Principal Investigator is the “Project manager” of a time allocation.
  This user can add/remove users from the project and is usually the one that applied for the time allocation.
  All project related utilities are managed through SUPR, [https://supr.naiss.se](https://supr.naiss.se)


corehours
: Corehours refers to the number of processor units (cores) used to run a simulation multiplied by the duration of the job (t) in hours.
  Corehours (c) can be calculated if the number  of nodes (n), the duration in hours (t) and the number of
  cores per node (cpn) are known: c = n\*cpn\*t


NAISS
: NAISS or National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden is the infrastructure organization for high-performance computing,
  storage and data services for academic users in Sweden.


SUPR
: SUPR or Swedish User and Project Repository is the NAISS database used to keep track of persons, projects, project proposals and more.
  [https://supr.naiss.se](https://supr.naiss.se)


NAC
: NAC or National Allocations Committee handles all larger applications and allocations of NAISS.


NAC-wg
: National Allocations Committee Working Group is a group comprising
  of NAC members and experts from the various HPC centres in Sweden.


SLURM
: SLURM or Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management is an open-source cluster management
  and job scheduling system extensively used.


Kerberos
: Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol. It works on the basis of creating a *ticket*
  that is used for secure communication. You need to create a Kerberos ticket to log in to the clusters,
  run programs and get access to the home directory and transfer files.


CFS/Lustre
: Lustre is a high-performance parallel file system which is mounted on the clusters.
  Lustre provides fast access to large data files needed for large parallel applications,
  but is less suitable for dealing with many small operations on a large number of files.
