# NAISS support documentation

Support documentation for NAISS.
These pages are written using Hugo, with the exception
of the support/software pages which are written in mkDocs.
Both tools however enable to publish material in MarkDown.

## Installation and using mkDocs

1. Find instructions at [the Zensical documentation](https://zensical.org/docs/get-started/)
2. You need some extra extensions to render these documents
   1. In order to install attr_list, adminition and superfences
      `pip install Zensical-material`

## Published material

The published webpages reside on different location depending if you are changing
the support documentation or that main website.

### Main website

The primary document is available in `site`

### Support documentation

The primary document is available in `template/Zensical.yaml`
When site is build this file will act as a template, copied to
the main folder and software information will be added to it.
All the markdown file are found in `docs`

### Software documentation

All the markdown file are found in `software`
The primary document is available in `template/index.md`
When site is build this file will act as a template, copied to
the main folder and software information will be added to it.
Also there is a file called `clusters.yaml`
which directs what softwares will be published by pointing out active clusters, and their os.

### Files for software

Files for different software should be stored under *software/[software name]*

1. **general.md** Contains general information about the software and a section on how to use the software on clusters. If you want additional
   clusters with information on how to run on those, just add them to this file.
1. **versions.yaml** A YAML file containing information about at which clusters the software is installed and what versions are installed
1. **keywords.yaml** A YAML file containing information about what keywords could be associated with the software

## build site

To create material for Zensical just `zensical build`
which will create a `site` folder with all HTML files
for both hugo and Zensical.
This folder can the be moved to the actual site.

### Running site locally

In order to start Zensical at the local computer use `zensical serve`
from top level folder and navigate to `https://127.0.0.1:1313`

## publish site

In order to publish these documents to the official NAISS webportal we need to have a way to access this, which
is not in place at the moment.
Publishing is achieve by running command `make public`
